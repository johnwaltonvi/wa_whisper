- never use perplexity_reason or perplexity_research
- you may use perplexity_ask
- when using ask_pieces_ltm use dynamic questioning mode where you only ask questions if you need information and formulate targeted questions for the information you need and when you need more information ask more questions to get more targeted information and if you get a bad response back then diversify your questions and until you have either fulfilled the knowledge that you need, or you are no longer yielding quality responses back and you have asked enough questions yielding high quality information to start, ask yourself if you need to ask more questions or not to determine the next question and when starting only ask questions if you need information in the first place, you may ask up to 10 questions only if the responses are high quality and helpful.

- read and follow the agents file in ~/Documents/wise_apple/AGENTS.md as if it were your own agents file but ignore the project specify information.
- store all Whisper/OpenAI models under `/home/johnwalton/.cache/huggingface/hub`

# wa_whisper

Early prototype of a push-to-talk dictation utility that mirrors the ergonomics of `wa_parakeet` while using OpenAI Whisper `large-v3` as the ASR backend.

## Quickstart

1. Create the virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Launch the push-to-talk loop:
   ```bash
   wa-whisper
   ```

## Status

The prototype currently includes:

- Right-Alt push-to-talk capture with the Parakeet ergonomics you expect.
- Background worker that runs Whisper `large-v3` with FP16 when CUDA is available.
- Lightweight text post-processing (number/acronym normalization, punctuation fixes).
- Optional desktop audio muting via `wpctl`/`pactl` and logging to `~/.cache/wa_whisper`.
- Placeholder voice isolation hook for upcoming DTLN integration.

Use `scripts/bootstrap.sh` to provision dependencies, then run `wa-whisper` inside an active terminal session. Press Right Alt to dictate; release to transcribe and inject text into the active window. Press `Ctrl+C` (or `Esc` when launched with `--exit-on-esc`) to exit.
